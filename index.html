            <img src="assets/images/ryanphoto.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

            <p>My name is Ryan Kaplan. I am looking to make a big change in careers so that I can better provide for my
                family and love what I do.</p>

            <p>I received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a concentration in marketing from the George
                Washington University in Washington D.C. I also have an MBA in Entrpreneurial Studies from Pace
                University in NYC.</p>

            <p>For the last 8 years I have been working in marketing and sales. I believe that my intelligence,
                creativity, and interests are better served by a career in coding.</p>

            <p>I am currently married, have 3 kids, and live in West Orange, NJ. In my free time I love to listen to
                podcasts and music, see live shows, and play video games.</p>
